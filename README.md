# Transformation-Matrices-between-Frames
When we have corresponding points between 2 frames, We can create a transformation matrices to transfer coordinates.
What we need here are 3 points from both the planes incase this is a 2D formation else 4 points incase this is a 3-D transformation.
The scripts here are not meant to form transformation matrix when we already know the variation rotation and translation between the frames.
When we know all the rotation and translation. We don't need any codes though. We can calculate it theoretically. This approach is more applied in a realistic scenario.

The only condition that we should keep in mind is that, the points should be perfectly aligned with each other.
